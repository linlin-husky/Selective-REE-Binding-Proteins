"""Variant name normalization and classifier for the literature corpus.

This module handles two distinct concerns kept separate by design:

  1. Normalization (`normalize_variant_name`): collapses surface-level
     variations of the same name (case, whitespace, missing tags,
     orphan mutations) into a canonical token. Pure string conditioning,
     no biology.

  2. Classification (added in subsequent commits): maps the canonical
     token to its construct_type, parent_scaffold, and (where relevant)
     a MOESM3 ortholog index for joining. This is the biology layer.

The normalizer runs first. The classifier consumes its output.

Run as a script for a quick smoke test:
    python -m agentic_ai.loaders.variant_aliases

# Notes:
#   - The 6 MOESM3-native 'o-N' identifiers are NOT in this map; they
#     are populated by the MOESM3 loader directly.
#   - The 4 Tier 1 canonical aliases (Mex-LanM, etc.) are also handled
#     upstream: by the time classification runs, they have already been
#     resolved to 'o-N' form by resolve_to_canonical_id().
#   - Construct types come from the controlled vocabulary in
#     agentic_ai.schemas._KNOWN_CONSTRUCT_TYPES.
#   - parent_scaffold values come from agentic_ai.schemas._KNOWN_SCAFFOLDS,
#     with 'unknown' for variants whose scaffold lineage is not confirmed.
