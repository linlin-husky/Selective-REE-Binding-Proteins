"""Persistence layer for PaperExtraction records (Week 1 Block 4.3.5).

Saves each PaperExtraction as a single JSON file under
data/processed/extractions/, named by paper_id. Loading reads the
directory back into memory as a dict[paper_id, PaperExtraction].

This persistence layer is what turns the in-memory CrewAI output into a
reproducible dataset: once persisted, downstream code (Block 5 merge,
Week 2 feature engineering, Week 3 ML training) can iterate without
re-running the agent and re-paying for the API.
