"""EF-hand motif detection in protein sequences (Week 2 Block 2.2a).

Provides find_ef_hand_motifs() which locates Lanmodulin-family EF-hand
coordination loops within a protein sequence. The detector uses a
permissive regex empirically validated against the 616-sequence MOESM3
corpus (recovers exactly 4 motifs in 67% of orthologs and 3-or-4 in
78%, vs ~3% with the strict canonical motif).

This module only finds motifs and reports their positions. Feature
extraction from those motifs (per-position residues, aggregate
spacing, etc.) lives in Block 2.2b.

The motif length is 6 residues, matching the conserved core of the
canonical 12-residue EF-hand loop (positions 1-6 of the loop, which
include both anchoring Asps and the conserved DG dinucleotide).
