# REE-Binding Protein Selectivity Predictor

End-to-end machine learning project that predicts rare earth element (REE)
selectivity of Lanmodulin (LanM) protein orthologs from amino acid sequence
features. Combines a published high-throughput selectivity dataset (616 orthologs
× 15 REEs) with literature-derived binding-constant annotations extracted by a
CrewAI agent from peer-reviewed papers.

## Project Goal

Build a sequence-to-selectivity predictor that can:
1. Take a protein amino acid sequence as input
2. Predict its selectivity profile across 15 rare earth elements
3. Help R&D teams in biomining/separation prioritize variants for wet-lab testing

## Tech Stack

- **Data pipeline:** pandas, Pydantic, CrewAI, OpenAI API
- **Bioinformatics:** Biopython (sequence feature engineering)
- **ML:** scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **App / MLOps:** Streamlit, Docker
- **Dev:** pytest (with branch coverage), flake8, pylint

## Data Sources

### Primary dataset

**Diep et al. 2026 — A family portrait of lanmodulin selectivity for enhanced
rare-earth separations.** *Nature Chemical Biology* 22, 829–839.
DOI: [10.1038/s41589-026-02176-3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-026-02176-3)

Supplementary Data 1 from this paper provides a high-throughput selectivity
dataset of 616 LanM orthologs across 15 rare earth elements, including full
amino acid sequences, source organism taxonomy, raw ICP-MS measurements (3
replicates), normalized logD values, and 8 agglomerative selectivity clusters.
This is the project's main ML training set (~9,240 variant × element records).

### Literature annotation corpus

15 peer-reviewed papers on Lanmodulin engineering and characterization, used
by the CrewAI agent to enrich the primary dataset with published binding
constants (Kd, Kd_app), engineered mutations, and coordination chemistry
notes. Papers were pre-processed with Gemini 2.5 Pro to extract verbatim
relevant passages prior to LLM extraction. See `agentic_ai/inputs/processed/`.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # add your OpenAI API key
```

## Reproducing the project

To reproduce the full pipeline you need the supplementary data:

1. Download `41589_2026_2176_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx` from the Diep et al. 2026
   paper (Nature Chemical Biology) → place in `data/raw/supplementary/`
2. Run `python -m agentic_ai.main` to verify environment + API connectivity
3. Run `pytest` to confirm the test suite passes
4. (Further steps documented as project progresses through Weeks 2-5)
